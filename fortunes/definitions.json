FROB connotes aimless manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross\nmanipulation, often a coarse search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes\nfine-tuning.  If someone is turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's\ncarefully adjusting it he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it\nbut looking at the screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just\ndoing it because turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.",

Pull one of these\n\thorses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all\n\tof these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you\n\ttook out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k\n\thorses now in the set are the same color.

From the little that has seeped out, it would appear that\nMAFIA operates under a non-standard protocol, OMERTA, a tight-lipped\nvariant of SNA, in which extended handshakes also perform complex\nsecurity functions.  The known timesharing aspects of MAFIA point to a\nmore than usually autocratic operating system.  Screen prompts carry an\nimperative, nonrefusable weighting (most menus offer simple YES/YES\noptions, defaulting to YES) that precludes indifference or delay.\nUniquely, all editing under MAFIA is performed centrally, using a\npowerful rubout feature capable of erasing files, filors, filees, and\nentire nodal aggravations.\n\t\t-- Stan Kelly-Bootle, \"The Devil's DP Dictionary\"",

If you reread\nyour work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can be\navoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must not shift your point of\nview.  And don't start a sentence with a conjunction.  (Remember, too, a\npreposition is a terrible word to end a sentence with.) Don't overuse\nexclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long\nsentences, as of 10 or more words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully,\ndangling participles must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end of\na sentence, a linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing\nmetaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should be\ncareful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing.\nAlways pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows the verb.  Last\nbut not least, avoid cliches like the plague; seek viable alternatives.",
