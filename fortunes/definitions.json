Pull one of these\n\thorses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all\n\tof these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you\n\ttook out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k\n\thorses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses\n\tare all the same color.  We have k true => k+1 true; therefore all\n\thorses are the same color.\nTheorem: All horses have an infinite number of legs.\nProof (by intimidation):\n\tEveryone would agree that all horses have an even number of legs.  It\n\tis also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in\n\tback.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a\n\thorse to have!  Now the only number that is both even and odd is\n\tinfinity; therefore all horses have an infinite number of legs.\n\tHowever, suppose that there is a horse somewhere that does not have an\n\tinfinite number of legs.  Well, that would be a horse of a different\n\tcolor; and by the Lemma, it doesn't exist.",

If you reread\nyour work, you can find on rereading a great deal of repetition can be\navoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must not shift your point of\nview.

Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long\nsentences, as of 10 or more words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully,\ndangling participles must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end of\na sentence, a linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing\nmetaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should be\ncareful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing.\nAlways pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows the verb.
