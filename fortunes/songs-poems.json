Alexander Pope called him \"wretched Wither\" and Dryden said of his\nverse that \"if they rhymed and rattled all was well\".\n\tIn our own time, \"The Dictionary of National Biography\" notes that his\nwork \"is mainly remarkable for its mass, fluidity and flatness.  It usually\nlacks any genuine literary quality and often sinks into imbecile doggerel\".\n\tHigh praise, indeed, and it may tempt you to savour a typically\nrewarding stanza: It is taken from \"I loved a lass\" and is concerned with\nthe higher emotions.\n\t\tShe would me \"Honey\" call,\n\t\tShe'd -- O she'd kiss me too.\n\t\tBut now alas!  She's left me\n\t\tFalero, lero, loo.\n\tAmong other details of his mistress which he chose to immortalize\nwas her prudent choice of footwear.\n\t\tThe fives did fit her shoe.\n\tIn 1639 the great poet's life was endangered after his capture by\nthe Royalists during the English Civil War.  When Sir John Denham, the\nRoyalist poet, heard of Wither's imminent execution, he went to the King and\nbegged that his life be spared.  When asked his reason, Sir John replied,\n\"Because that so long as Wither lived, Denham would not be accounted the\nworst poet in England.\"\n\t\t-- Stephen Pile, \"The Book of Heroic Failures\"",
