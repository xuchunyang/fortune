Malone turns around to see\nhis wife, with a face grim as death, stalking to the bar.\n\tSlapping a four-bit piece down on the bar, she draws herself up to her\nfull five feet five inches and says to Mulcahey, \"Give me what himself has\nbeen havin' all these years.\"\n\tMulcahey looks at Malone, who shrugs, and then back at Margaret Mary\nMalone.  He sets out a glass and pours her a triple shot of Rye.  The bar is\ntotally silent as they watch the woman pick up the glass and knock back the\ndrink.  She slams the glass down on the bar, gasps, shudders slightly, and\npasses out; falling straight back, stiff as a board, saved from sudden contact\nwith the barroom floor by the ample belly of Seamus Fogerty.\n\tSometime later, she comes to on the pool table, a jacket under her\nhead.  Her bloodshot eyes fell upon her husband, who says, \"And all these\nyears you've been thinkin' I've been enjoying meself.\"",
