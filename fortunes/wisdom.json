Wisdom was not at the top of the\ngraduate school mountain but there in the sandbox at nursery school.\n\tThese are the things I learned:  Share everything.  Play fair.  Don't\nhit people.  Put things back where you found them.  Clean up your own mess.\nDon't take things that aren't yours.   Say you're sorry when you hurt someone.\nWash your hands before you eat.  Flush.  Warm cookies and cold milk are good\nfor you.  Live a balanced life.  Learn some and think some and draw and paint\nand sing and dance and play and work some every day.\n\tTake a nap every afternoon.  When you go out into the world, watch for\ntraffic, hold hands, and stick together.  Be aware of wonder.  Remember the\nlittle seed in the plastic cup.   The roots go down and the plant goes up and\nnobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that.  Goldfish and\nhamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the plastic cup -- they all\ndie.  So do we.\n\tAnd then remember the book about Dick and Jane and the first word you\nlearned, the biggest word of all: LOOK.  Everything you need to know is in\nthere somewhere.  The Golden Rule and love and basic sanitation.  Ecology and\npolitics and sane living.\n\tThink of what a better world it would be if we all -- the whole world\n-- had cookies and milk about 3 o'clock every afternoon and then lay down with\nour blankets for a nap.  Or if we had a basic policy in our nation and other\nnations to always put things back where we found them and cleaned up our own\nmesses.  And it is still true, no matter how old you are, when you go out into\nthe world it is best to hold hands and stick together.\n\t\t-- Robert Fulghum, \"All I ever really needed to know I learned\n\t\t   in kindergarten\"",
