Is the work of some mere individual mind likely to\nserve the aims of collectively accepted compromises, which are known in the\nschools as 'standards'?  Any mind that would audaciously put itself forth to\nwork all alone is surely a bad example for the students, and probably, if\nnot downright antisocial, at least a little off-center, self-indulgent,\nelitist.  ... It's just good pedagogy, therefore, to stay away from such\nstuff, and use instead, if film-strips and rap-sessions must be\nsupplemented, 'texts,' selected, or prepared, or adapted, by real\nprofessionals.  Those texts are called 'reading material.'  They are the\nacademic equivalent of the 'listening material' that fills waiting-rooms,\nand the 'eating material' that you can buy in thousands of convenient eating\nresource centers along the roads.\n\t\t-- The Underground Grammarian",
