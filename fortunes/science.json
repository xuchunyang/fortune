Did you\nnotice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain?  This\nteaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force, but we must never\nuse it to hurt others unless we need to learn an important electrical lesson.\n\tIt also teaches us how an electrical circuit works.  When you scuffed\nyour feet, you picked up batches of \"electrons\", which are very small objects\nthat carpet manufacturers weave into carpets so they will attract dirt.\nThe electrons travel through your bloodstream and collect in your finger,\nwhere they form a spark that leaps to your friend's filling, then travels\ndown to his feet and back into the carpet, thus completing the circuit.\n\tAmazing Electronic Fact: If you scuffed your feet long enough without\ntouching anything, you would build up so many electrons that your finger\nwould explode!  But this is nothing to worry about unless you have\ncarpeting.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"What is Electricity?\"",

In higher\nconcentrations, e.g. 20%, the toxic effect is somewhat delayed and it\ntakes about 2.5 billion inhalations before death takes place.  The reason\nfor the delay is the difference in the mechanism of the toxic effect of\noxygen in 20% concentration.  It apparently contributes to a complex\nprocess called aging, of which very little is known, except that it is\nalways fatal.\n\nHowever, the main disadvantage of the 20% oxygen concentration is in the\nfact it is habit forming.  The first inhalation (occurring at birth) is\nsufficient to make oxygen addiction permanent.  After that, any\nconsiderable decrease in the daily oxygen doses results in death with\nsymptoms resembling those of cyanide poisoning.\n\nOxygen is an extreme fire hazard.  All of the fires that were reported in\nthe continental U.S. for the period of the past 25 years were found to be\ndue to the presence of this gas in the atmosphere surrounding the buildings\nin question.\n\nOxygen is especially dangerous because it is odorless, colorless and\ntasteless, so that its presence can not be readily detected until it is\ntoo late.\n\t\t-- Chemical & Engineering News February 6, 1956",

The light we\nreceive from the Moon is one ten-thousandth of the light we receive from the\nSun, so we can ignore that.  With these data we can compute the temperature\nof Heaven.  The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where\nthe heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation,\ni.e., Heaven loses fifty times as much heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using\nthe Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E)^4 = 50, where E is the absolute\ntemperature of the earth (-300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact\ntemperature of Hell cannot be computed, but it must be less than 444.6C, the\ntemperature at which brimstone or sulphur changes from a liquid to a gas.\nRevelations 21:8 says \"But the fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their\npart in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.\"  A lake of molten\nbrimstone means that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point,\nor 444.6C  (Above this point it would be a vapor, not a lake.)

It's something like this: Formerly the sea was fresh water and\nsalt was rare and expensive.  A miller received from a wizard a wonderful\nmachine that just ground salt out of itself all day long.  At first the miller\nthought himself the most fortunate man in the world, but soon all the villages\nhad salt to last them for centuries and still the machine kept on grinding\nmore salt.  The miller had to move out of his house, he had to move off his\nacres.  At last he determined that he would sink the machine in the sea and\nbe rid of it.  But the mill ground so fast that boat and miller and machine\nwere sunk together, and down below, the mill still went on grinding and that's\nwhy the sea is salt.\"\n\t\"I don't get you,\" said the assistant.\n\t\t-- Guy Endore, \"Men of Iron\"",
