During an\nimpassioned House debate over a proposed bill to \"expand oyster and\nclam research,\" a sharp-eared informant transcribed the following\nexchange between our hero and Rep. John D. Dingell, also of Michigan.\n\nDINGELL: There are places in the world at the present time where we are\n\t having to artificially propagate oysters and clams.\nHOFFMAN: You mean the oysters I buy are not nature's oysters?\nDINGELL: They may or may not be natural.  The simple fact of the matter\n\t is that female oysters through their living habits cast out\n\t large amounts of seed and the male oysters cast out large\n\t amounts of fertilization ...\nHOFFMAN: Wait a minute!  I do not want to go into that.  There are many\n\t teenagers who read The Congressional Record.",

Connellan, president of The Management Group, Inc.\nSpeaking to business executives in Chicago and quoted in Automotive News,\nConnellan attributed a measure of America's falling productivity to an excess\nof attorneys and accountants, and a dearth of production experts.  Lawyers\nand accountants \"do not make the economic pie any bigger; they only figure\nout how the pie gets divided.  Neither profession provides any added value\nto product.\"\n\tAccording to Connellan, the highly productive Japanese society has\n10 lawyers and 30 accountants per 100,000 population.  The U.S. has 200\nlawyers and 700 accountants.  This suggests that \"the U.S. proportion of\npie-bakers and pie-dividers is way out of whack.\"  Could Dick Butcher have\nbeen an efficiency expert?\n\t\t-- Motor Trend, May 1983",

The oldest one is\nthe Vastgota law which clearly has pagan influences, thinly covered with some\nChristian stuff.  In this law, we find a page about \"lekare\", which is the\nOld Norse word for a performing artist, actor/jester/musician etc.  Here is\nan approximate translation, where I have written \"artist\" as equivalent of\n\"lekare\".\n\t\"If an artist is beaten, none shall pay fines for it.  If an artist\n\tis wounded, one such who goes with hurdie-gurdie or travels with\n\tfiddle or drum, then the people shall take a wild heifer and bring\n\tit out on the hillside.  Then they shall shave off all hair from the\n\theifer's tail, and grease the tail.  Then the artist shall be given\n\tnewly greased shoes.  Then he shall take hold of the heifer's tail,\n\tand a man shall strike it with a sharp whip.  If he can hold her, he\n\tshall have the animal.  If he cannot hold her, he shall endure what\n\the received, shame and wounds.\"",

But is drug testing in fact rationally related to the\nresurrection of competitiveness?  Will charging the atmosphere of the\nworkplace with the fear of excretory betrayal honestly spur productivity?\nMuch noise has been made about rehabilitating the worker using drugs, but\nto date the vast majority of programs end with the simple firing or the not\nhiring of the abuser.  This practice may exacerbate, not alleviate, the\nnation's productivity problem.  If economic rehabilitation is the ultimate\ngoal of drug testing, then criteria abandoning the rehabilitation of the\ndrug-using worker is the purest of hypocrisy and the worst of rationalization.\n\t\t-- The concluding paragraph of \"Constitutional Law: The\n\t\t   Fourth Amendment and Drug Testing in the Workplace,\"\n\t\t   Tim Moore, Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy, vol.\n\t\t   10, No. 3 (Summer 1987), pp. 762-768.",
