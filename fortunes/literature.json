They can paint the walls with aggressively\ncheerful primary colors and splashy bold graphics, but it's still a holding\nplace for the dead until they can be parted out to organ banks.  Not that I\nwould have cared normally but my viewpoint was skewed.  The relentless\npleasance of the room I sat in seemed only grotesque.\n\t\t-- Pat Cadigan, \"Mindplayers\"",

      "content": "\"Good afternoon, madam.  How may I help you?\"\n\n\"Good afternoon.  I'd like a FrintArms HandCannon, please.\"\n\n\"A--?  Oh, now, that's an awfully big gun for such a lovely lady.  I\nmean, not everybody thinks ladies should carry guns at all, though I\nsay they have a right to.  But I think... I might... Let's have a look\ndown here.  I might have just the thing for you.  Yes, here we are!\nLook at that, isn't it neat?  Now that is a FrintArms product as well,\nbut it's what's called a laser -- a light-pistol some people call\nthem.  Very small, as you see; fits easily into a pocket or bag; won't\nspoil the line of a jacket; and you won't feel you're lugging half a\ntonne of iron around with you.  We do a range of matching accessories,\nincluding -- if I may say so -- a rather saucy garter holster.  Wish I\ngot to do the fitting for that!  Ha -- just my little joke.  And\nthere's *even*... here we are -- this special presentation pack: gun,\ncharged battery, charging unit, beautiful glider-hide shoulder holster\nwith adjustable fitting and contrast stitching, and a discount on your\nnext battery.  Full instructions, of course, and a voucher for free\nlessons at your local gun club or range.  Or there's the *special*\npresentation pack; it has all the other one's got but with *two*\ncharged batteries and a night-sight, too.  Here, feel that -- don't\nworry, it's a dummy battery -- isn't it neat?  Feel how light it is?\nSmooth, see?  No bits to stick out and catch on your clothes, *and*\nbeautifully balanced.  And of course the beauty of a laser is, there's\nno recoil.  Because it's shooting light, you see?  Beautiful gun,\nbeautiful gun; my wife has one.  Really.  That's not a line, she\nreally has.  Now, I can do you that one -- with a battery and a free\ncharge -- for ninety-five; or the presentation pack on a special\noffer for one-nineteen; or this, the special presentation pack, for\none-forty-nine.\"\n\n\"I'll take the special.\"\n\n\"Sound choice, madam, *sound* choice.  Now, do--?\"\n\n\"And a HandCannon, with the eighty-mill silencer, five GP clips, three\nsix-five AP/wire-fl'\bechettes clips, two bipropellant HE clips, and a\nSpecial Projectile Pack if you have one -- the one with the embedding\nrounds, not the signalers.  I assume the night-sight on this toy is\ncompatible?\"\n\n\"Aah... yes,  And how does madam wish to pay?\"\n\nShe slapped her credit card on the counter.  \"Eventually.\"\n\n\t\t-- Iain M. Banks, \"Against a Dark Background\"",
