The only way to correct this is to rewrite the\nprogram.\n\t\t-- Geoffrey James, \"The Tao of Programming\"",

John Knivlen, Chairman of Polamar Repeater Club, an amateur radio\ngroup, had discovered how IC circuits work.  He says that smoke is the thing\nthat makes ICs work because every time you let the smoke out of an IC circuit,\nit stops working.  He claims to have verified this with thorough testing.\n\tI was flabbergasted!  Of course!  Smoke makes all things electrical\nwork.  Remember the last time smoke escaped from your Lucas voltage regulator\nDidn't it quit working?  I sat and smiled like an idiot as more of the truth\ndawned.  It's the wiring harness that carries the smoke from one device to\nanother in your Mini, MG or Jag.  And when the harness springs a leak, it lets\nthe smoke out of everything at once, and then nothing works.  The starter motor\nrequires large quantities of smoke to operate properly, and that's why the wire\ngoing to it is so large.\n\tFeeling very smug, I continued to expand my hypothesis.  Why are Lucas\nelectronics more likely to leak than say Bosch?  Hmmm...  Aha!!!  Lucas is\nBritish, and all things British leak!  British convertible tops leak water,\nBritish engines leak oil, British displacer units leak hydrostatic fluid, and\nI might add Brititsh tires leak air, and the British defense unit leaks\nsecrets... so naturally British electronics leak smoke.\n\t\t-- Jack Banton, PCC Automotive Electrical School\n\n\t[Ummm ...

Post Center of Long\nIsland University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-\ntrators that the first computer \"bug\" was a real bug--a moth.  At Harvard\none August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were working on the\n\"granddaddy\" of modern computers, the Mark I.  \"Things were going badly;\nthere was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosed\ncomputer,\" she said.  \"Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using\nordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.  From then on, when\nanything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it.\"  Hopper\nsaid that when the veracity of her story was questioned recently, \"I referred\nthem to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface Weapons\nCenter, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page in\nquestion.\"\n\t\t[actually, the term \"bug\" had even earlier usage in\n\t\tregard to problems with radio hardware.

Before you make the copies, send a chip or\nother bit of hardware, and 100 lines of 'C' code to the first person on the\nlist given at the bottom of this letter.  Then delete their name and add\nyours to the bottom of the list.\n\nDon't break the chain!  Make the copy within 48 hours.  Gerald R. of San\nDiego failed to send out his ten copies and woke the next morning to find\nhis job description changed to \"COBOL programmer.\"  Fred A. of New York sent\nout his ten copies and within a month had enough hardware and software to\nbuild a Cray dedicated to playing Zork.  Martha H. of Chicago laughed at\nthis letter and broke the chain.  Shortly thereafter, a fire broke out in\nher terminal and she now spends her days writing documentation for IBM PC's.\n\nDon't break the chain!  Send out your ten copies today!\nFor example, if \\thinmskip = 3mu, this makes \\thickmskip = 6mu.  But if\nyou also want to use \\skip12 for horizontal glue, whether in math mode or\nnot, the amount of skipping will be in points (e.g., 6pt).  The rule is\nthat glue in math mode varies with the size only when it is an \\mskip;\nwhen moving between an mskip and ordinary skip, the conversion factor\n1mu=1pt is always used.

The following story is told about him: when they\nmoved from Cambridge to Newton his wife, knowing that he would be absolutely\nuseless on the move, packed him off to MIT while she directed the move.  Since\nshe was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had\nmoved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to\nhim.  Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.  He\nreached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled\nsome notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and\nthrew the piece of paper away.  At the end of the day he went home (to the\nold address in Cambridge, of course).  When he got there he realized that they\nhad moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of\npaper with the address was long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There\nwas a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where\nhe had moved to, saying, \"Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I'm Norbert Weiner\nand we've just moved.  Would you know where we've moved to?\"  To which the\nyoung girl replied, \"Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget.\"\n\tThe capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the\nstory) about the truth of the story, many years later.  She said that it wasn't\nquite true -- that he never forgot who his children were!  The rest of it,\nhowever, was pretty close to what actually happened...\n\t\t-- Richard Harter",

My favorite is `nitwit' -- and the rationale\nis the Internet philosophy has always been you have extremely bright,\nnon-partisan researchers look at a topic, do world-class research, do\nseveral competing implementations, have a bake-off, determine what works\nbest, write it down and make that the standard.\n\tThe OSI view is entirely opposite.  You take written contributions\nfrom a much larger community, you put the contributions in a room of\ncommittee people with, quite honestly, vast political differences and all\nwith their own political axes to grind, and four years later you get\nsomething out, usually without it ever having been implemented once.\n\tSo the Internet perspective is implement it, make it work well,\nthen write it down, whereas the OSI perspective is to agree on it, write\nit down, circulate it a lot and now we'll see if anyone can implement it\nafter it's an international standard and every vendor in the world is\ncommitted to it.  One of those processes is backwards, and I don't think\nit takes a Lucasian professor of physics at Oxford to figure out which.\n\t\t-- Marshall Rose, \"The Pied Piper of OSI\"",

Ten percent of our\nVAXs are going for UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple language, easy to understand,\neasy to get started with. It's great for students, great for somewhat casual\nusers, and it's great for interchanging programs between different machines.\nAnd so, because of its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We have\ngood UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.\n\tIt is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run\nout of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and will end\nup doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.\n\tWith UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and quickly\ncheck that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With VMS, no matter\nwhat you look for -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of documentation -- if\nyou look long enough it's there.  That's the difference -- the beauty of UNIX\nis it's simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it's all there.\n\t\t-- Ken Olsen, president of DEC, DECWORLD Vol. 8 No. 5, 1984\n[It's been argued that the beauty of UNIX is the same as the beauty of Ken\nOlsen's brain.

The problem\nof frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas\nof computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-\nbian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size\npond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show that\nthere is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program\nto a frog.  We will suggest these represent a proper subset of frog-computable\nfunctions.\n\tThis is not just a let's-see-how-far-those-frogs-can-jump seminar.\nThis is only for hardcore amphibian-computation people and their colleagues.\n\tRefreshments will be served.

But knowledge alone is not\nsufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly, \nwe have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call \n\"wisdom engineering\".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a \nwisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.  \nIMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom \nabout such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so \nforth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic \nrules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL \nsucceeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed \nin western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those \nunderlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory\nof value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe \nIMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly \ndiscuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.",

In fact, detachable magazines \nfor the Uzi are available in 25-, 32-, and 40-round capacities, so you can \ntake out an entire office full of Apple II or IBM Personal Computers tied\ninto Ethernet or other local-area networks.  What about the new 16-bit\ncomputers, like the Lisa and Fortune?  Even with the Winchester backup, \nthey're no match for the Uzi.  One quick burst and they'll find out what \nUnix means.  Make your commanding officer proud.  Get an Uzi -- and come home\na winner in the fight for office automatic weapons.\n\t\t-- \"InfoWorld\", June, 1984",

But since we weren't sure whether it was OK to name our protocol\nafter this popular television and movie star, we pretended that KERMIT was an\nacronym; unfortunately, we could never find a good set of words to go with the\nletters, as readers of some of our early source code can attest.  Later, while\nlooking through a name book for his forthcoming baby, Bill Catchings noticed\nthat \"Kermit\" was a Celtic word for \"free\", which is what all Kermit programs\nshould be, and words to this effect replaced the strained acronyms in our\nsource code (Bill's baby turned out to be a girl, so he had to name her Becky\ninstead).  When BYTE Magazine was preparing our 1984 Kermit article for\npublication, they suggested we contact Henson Associates Inc. for permission\nto say that we did indeed name the protocol after Kermit the Frog.  Permission\nwas kindly granted, and now the real story can be told.
