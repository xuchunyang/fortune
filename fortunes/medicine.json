To investigate its internal\ngases he inserted a tube into that end of the animal not capable of facial\nexpression and struck a match.  The jet of flame set fire first to some\nbales of hay and then to the whole farm causing damage estimate at L45,000. \nThe vet was later fined L140 for starting a fire in a manner surprising to\nthe magistrates.
