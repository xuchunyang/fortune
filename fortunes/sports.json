For instance, a\n\t   Frisbee will always head directly towards a policeman or\n\t   a little old lady rather than the beat up Chevy.\n\t(4) Your best throw happens when no one is watching; when the\n\t   cute girl you've been trying to impress is watching, the\n\t   Frisbee will invariably bounce out of your hand or hit you\n\t   in the head and knock you silly.",
