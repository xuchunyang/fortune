Prejudice is making a judgment before you have\nlooked at the facts.  Postjudice is making a judgment afterwards.

Many well-meaning persons suppose that the discus-\n sion respecting the means for baffling the supposed safety of locks offers a\n premium for dishonesty, by showing others how to be dishonest.  This is a fal-\n lacy.  Rogues are very keen in their profession, and already know much more\n than we can teach them respecting their several kinds of roguery.  Rogues knew\n a good deal about lockpicking long before locksmiths discussed it among them-\n selves, as they have lately done.  If a lock -- let it have been made in what-\n ever country, or by whatever maker -- is not so inviolable as it has hitherto\n been deemed to be, surely it is in the interest of *honest* persons to know\n this fact, because the *dishonest* are tolerably certain to be the first to\n apply the knowledge practically; and the spread of knowledge is necessary to\n give fair play to those who might suffer by ignorance.  It cannot be too ear-\n nestly urged, that an acquaintance with real facts will, in the end, be better\n for all parties.\"\n-- Charles Tomlinson's Rudimentary Treatise on the Construction of Locks, \n   published around 1850 ",

I never cut out words in the middle of a quote without a VERY \ngood reason, and I never cut them out without including ellipses.  For \ninstance, \"I am not a goob\" might become \"I am ... a goob\", but that's too \nmundane to bother with.  \"I'm flame proof\" might (and has) become \n\"I'm ...a... p...oof\" but that's REALLY stretching it.\n\n\tTwo.  If I cut words off the beginning or end of a quote, I don't\nput ellipses, but neither do I capitalize something that wasn't capitalized\nbefore the cut. \"I don't think that the Church of Ubizmo is a wonderful\nplace\" would turn into \"the Church of Ubizmo is a wonderful place\".  Imagine\nthe posting as a tape-recording of the poster's thoughts.  If I can set\nup the quote via fast-forwarding and stopping the tape, and without splicing,\nI don't put ellipses in.
